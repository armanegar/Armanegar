üìñ Currently Learning
I am always striving to keep my knowledge up-to-date. Currently, I am enhancing my design and user experience skills to create more beautiful and user-friendly presentations.

üëæ Future Prospects
I am continuously exploring new horizons. My passion for science and technology drives me to develop my knowledge and skills in parallel fields.

On one hand, I aim to master Python programming and its vast applications, from machine learning to data analysis and complex software development. This journey is geared towards a deeper understanding of technical and technological challenges.

On the other hand, I am also keen on expanding my knowledge in scientific and philosophical areas. Topics such as quantum physics, the theory of relativity, and other complex scientific subjects captivate my mind. I am on a quest for new answers and the expansion of human knowledge.

This perpetual curiosity and pursuit in both domains are my main motivations for growth and development, and I hope to achieve a deeper understanding of these subjects in the future.
